Introduction
============

This is a trivial Ruby on Rails application set up to deploy to a server using Capistrano.
The interesting bits really are the Gemfile, the Capfile, the config/deploy.rb and config/deploy/* scripts and the 
lib/capistrano/tasks/* scripts.

For instructions and background, see https://gorails.com/deploy/ubuntu/14.04 and
